Windows Object Library Framework (WOLF)

Back when I was a poor student in 1994, I would do some Windows development
now and then.  I had seen a couple of books for Borland's OWL and wished I
had had the money to buy it.

Instead, I started writing my own framework that used the same funky
"sort-of like a pure virtual function" declaration syntax that Borland used
after I reverse-engineered how they did it.

I even used this framework to create a level editor for the MUD I played at
the time.
