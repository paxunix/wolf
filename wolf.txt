THE WINDOWS OBJECT LIBRARY FRAMEWORK

FURTHER WOLF DEVELOPMENT
- consider adding code to use notification routines in TOOLHELP.DLL.  You only have to
  write minimal debugging code, and it will also take care of possible errors that
  happen in Windows code.
- for the final compilation:
	- use IMPDEF to make the export list for the DEF file.  This way, if
	  you add functions to WOLF, old apps will work with the new DLL,
	  since the old apps will call functions by the original export 
	  ordinal number.  New functions (of course) will have different
	  ordinal numbers.
	- optimize for speed
	- in all constructors, all data members are initialized to either zero or
	  their value from their constructor's parameter list or to a default value
	- all dynamically allocated WOLF objects are deleted under all circumstances
	- all window properties set by WOLF are removed
	- no code will cause exceptions as long as valid values are used
	  (i.e. the WOLF code works, but the data you are giving it causes an
	  exception.)
	- compile with Standard Stack Frame off
- additional classes:
	- TPrint:  class to make printing painless
	- OLE/DDE
	- TGDI:  class to make GDI easier and more powerful
